# Honkai Star Rail Version 3.5 Characters Details
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/RSEqRnmWfsQ
#### Description:
My project is inspired by these websites that showcase character details, and in this specific project, I built a website that showcase limited characters that appeared in version 3.5 in Honkai: Star Rail, one of my favorite game.

There are four characters presented in version 3.5, Phainon, Sunday, Sparkle, and Tribbie, and I made html pages for each of them. First, I made index.html, the homepage that shows what characters presented in version 3.5. I imported images that shows what they look like using `<img>`, and I used hyperlinks to present their names so that if the user clicks the name, they will be redirected to that specific character page. Below the title there is a search bar, if the user wants to search for a specific character in version 3.5, they can just search it in the search bar, and once they entered a valid name and hit "search", they will automatically be redirected to that specific character page. I used some Bootstrap attributes such as class="col-md-6 mb-4 text-center" to help me design a better-looking page. Near the images I showed the users what elements and paths the characters are in as previews. In index.css, I made classes "title" and "name" to reduce the redundancy.

The other four htmls are phainon.html, sunday.html, sparkle.html, and tribbie.html, each presenting a specific character. In every one of these html pages, it has the character's name, character's lore, trailers, abilities, and leveled basic details. Those detailed elements can showcase the user how these characters work in the game. There are some hyperlinks that lead to the source of the information that was presented in the page. These hyperlinks allow users to explore deeper understanding of these characters and also are used for copyrights (although it is a student's private project). There are some advanced features in the pages, too. For example, I used `<navbar>` to implement a navigation bar so when the user clicks on that title, it will automatically jump into that section so the user does not need to scroll down to see the information, making it more user-friendly.

For designing and coloring, I implemented four separated css files so that each character page is unique based on the character's style. For example, in phainon.css, I mainly used the color blue, or #4FDEE3, matching the main theme of Phainon.
